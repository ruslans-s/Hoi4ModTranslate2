The turret was the same as in the T-26 m 1933 and BT-5 tanks, and also equipped with the 45mm 20K main gun. The biggest limitation of the BA-6 was the mobility, limited to roads or very hard ground, the result of unnecessarily large weight. The innovation that slightly improved mobility were the auxiliary tracks that could be fitted onto the rear tandem wheels, converting the car to half-track. The important improvements of the BA-6 were the new GK tires, filled with much less vulnerable sponge rubber. On the downside, the tires reduced both the speed and range. All cars of this series were very heavily armed for the era; they could knock out other vehicles with ease, including tanks. However, their thin armor of 9mm at the front and 15mm at the turret made them vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire and small caliber cannon fire."

The basic BA-10 design was developed from the BA-3/6 heavy armored cars and carried the same turret and 45mm 20K gun at a weight of around 5,2 tons. It had an improved GAZ-AAA chassis and improved armor (up to 15mm at front / turret). The BA-10 used a slightly smaller, better-sloped armor layout than that of the BA-6, thus improving protection while saving weight. The greater engine power (50 hp, compared to 40 hp on the BA-6) made the vehicle more reliable and allowed a top road speed of 53km/h. Like its predecessors, the BA-10 could be converted to a half-track by fitting auxiliary tracks to the rear pair of dual tandem wheels. The tracks were often fitted when the vehicle needed to move across snow or soft ground."

At 2,2 tons of weight, cheap and exceptionally reliable, it would later become the most common Soviet wheeled armoured fighting vehicle with over 9,000 being manufactured before production ended. The BA-64 represented an important watershed in Soviet armoured car technology, as its multi-faceted hull ( with frontal armour of 15mm) gave its crew superior protection from small arms fire and shell fragments compared to the BA-20. BA-64s also possessed a much higher power-to-weight ratio and the placement of their wheels at the extreme corners of the chassis resulted in exceptional manoeuvrability. The BA-64 was initially armed with a single 7.62mm Degtyaryov machine gun in an open-topped turret.The machine gun was mounted on a fixed mount that allowed it to be elevated sufficiently to engage low-flying aircraft."

After the First World War Britain disbanded most of its tank units. The engine was an air-cooled 90 HP Armstrong Siddeley engine derived from an aircraft type. Top road speed was about 24 km/h. The turret carried a "Quick Firing" (shell and cartridge in one complete round) 3-pounder gun (47mm L/32) and four Hotchkiss machine guns. A novel, unique feature was a three-man turret. no other manufacturer constructed a tank with a three-man turret until the German Panzer III. The crew of five was only poorly protected by 6.25 mm plating, rivetted to the chassis, barely enough to counter the threat posed by light machine guns. With its many shot traps the vehicle was unable to withstand even heavy machine gun fire and it had a high-profile."

The increase in the crew size made a lot of difference to the tank's effectiveness and spread the maintenance load. The armament of the Mark V was an improvement over the earlier Marks; a 0.5 inch (12,7mm) Vickers machine gun was added to the existing 0.303 ( 7,7mm). This gave the tank a reasonable anti-tank capability against other contemporary light tanks―at the time most european light tanks had around 12–14 millimetres  of armour―but it was not updated as more armoured light tanks came into use.

The 7.6 ton Tetrarchs can be transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders. It had a unusual steering and mechanical system which accomplished turns by the lateral movement of road wheels, which bowed the tracks. When the driver turned the steering wheel all eight road wheels not only turned but also tilted in order to bend the tracks and make the tank turn; the idea was to reduce the mechanical strain and waste of power caused by the traditional system used to turn tanks by braking one track.

The Mk III only differed from the Mk II by the position of the radio, which was moved to the hull in order to free some space inside the turret. In regards to protection it was felt to be a better mount than the Mk.I, and the practical rate of fire with 250-320 rounds/minute each increased massively compared to the slow firing single Bofors 40mm, but its effective combat ceiling suffered at being 900m. So a mix of both designs were preferred to be able to combat low and medium height targets."

It was a 33 ton multi-turret design, having a central gun turret armed with a 3 pounder gun (47 mm L/32), and four subsidiary turrets each armed with a 7,7mm Vickers machine gun. The subsidiary turrets were mounted two at the front and two to the rear of the. The gun of the left rear turret was able to elevate to engage aircraft. The tank was designed to have heavy firepower, self-defence capability, and superiority to enemy weapons. Its armour was very thin at a maximum of 38mm, but was increased with the production models. It also incorporated a new hydraulic braking system which had to be specially developed due to its weight and speed.

The Cromwell hull and turret with extra armour and the track and suspension of the 50-ton US M6 Heavy Tank which had been developed for both US and British was used. It was built with a widened Cromwell track and suspension by LMS and different armoured skirts. It only superficially resembled the Churchills. The design was armed with an Ordnance QF 75mm gun.

Abandoning the slow Infantry Tank concept, the "Universal Tank or MBT" concept was to design a vehicle with a mobility comparable to that of cruiser tanks, but with the armour and firepower of heavy tanks. The FV 200 series was adopted and was to serve as a multi-purpose line of AFV that used the same hull and chassis. The Caernavon II was a FV 201 chassis fitted with a 20-pounder gun in a Centurion Mk.III turret ( as the initially proposed 17 pounder gun was outdated). However as the Centurion Mk.III versions later proved to be superior to the Caernavon the chassis was used for developing the even heavier Conqueror MBT. The hull was rather weakly armoured with 76mm sloped armour but the turret had armour of 127mm. It weighed 55 tons and with its Meteor engine developing 800 HP a top road speed of 34 km/h was achieved."

After a series of fairly mediocre designs in the A series, and bearing in mind the threat posed by the German 88 mm gun, the War Office demanded a major revision of the design requirements. Initially planned to weigh no more than  41 tons, the final L7 105mm L/52 armed version Mk.III weighed 52 tons instead.  A high top speed was not considered important, while agility was to be equal to that of the Comet using the same Meteor engine. So the new design had excellent performance and a top road speed of 35 km/h. It had a larger hull by adapting the long-travel five-wheel Christie suspension used on the Comet with the addition of a sixth wheel and a simpler Horstmann suspension. The turret had 127mm of armour and the hull was redesigned with welded, sloped armour with a maximum of 110mm.

The Conqueror's role was to provide long range anti-tank support for the Centurion. The chassis was from the A 45 Infantry Support Tank. The armour front armour of 178mm was very heavy for the time. Unfortunately along with the huge turret required for the large gun and very large hull volume, made it very heavy, cumbersome and mechanically unreliable. Also, few bridges could support its weight. However, rather like the Churchill tank, the Conqueror had exceptional terrain handling characteristics and proved to be as capable cross country as the lighter (and on paper slightly faster) Centurion tank.

 JAP_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Type 92 10cm Cannon was developed as a long-range alternative to the existing 75mm field guns. It was initially designed in 1923 but production was delayed considerably due to IJA requirements to make the gun lighter and increase the range to 17.5 kilometers. Initial prototypes were built in 1932. While it had issues with transportability, it was otherwise successful. From 1932 to 1945, about 180 were built."

 CCP_submarine_1:0 "AG Class"
 CCP_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 CCP_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shchuka"
 CCP_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV K-Class"
 CCP_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 CCP_submarine_4:0 "Han Class"
 CCP_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 CCP_destroyer_1:0 "Type 30 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
 CCP_destroyer_2:0 "Type 39 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 CCP_destroyer_3:0 "Type 42 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 CCP_destroyer_4:0 "Type 52 Class"
 CCP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
 CCP_light_cruiser_1:0 "Type 28C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 CCP_light_cruiser_2:0 "Type 35C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 CCP_light_cruiser_3:0 "Type 44C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 CCP_light_cruiser_4:0 "Type 50C Class"
 CCP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Type 30HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Type 38HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Type 43HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Type 58HC Class"
 CCP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Type 40BC Class"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Type 51BC Class"
 CCP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 CCP_battleship_1:0 "Zhou  Class"
 CCP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 CCP_battleship_2:0 "Chen Class"
 CCP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 CCP_battleship_3:0 "Zhu De Class"
 CCP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 CCP_battleship_4:0 "Mao Class"
 CCP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 CCP_sh_battleship_1:0 "Type 50SHBB Project"
 CCP_sh_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 CCP_sh_battleship_2:0 "Type 59SHBB Project"
 CCP_sh_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 CCP_carrier_1:0 "Yulin Class"
 CCP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 CCP_carrier_2:0 "Shanghai Class"
 CCP_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 CCP_carrier_3:0 "Beijing Class"
 CCP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 CCP_carrier_4:0 "Liaoning Class"
 CCP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_06_short:0 "Lanchester 6x4"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_06_desc:0 "Developed during the 1920s by the Lanchester Motor Company, the 6x4 had good cross country performance and was easy to maintain. It featured a fully traversing, two-man turret, but the 90 hp engine struggled with the vehicle's weight. First deployed in 1929, it served into the 1930s before being phased out."
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_07:0 "Morris CS9 Armoured Car"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_07_short:0 "Morris CS9"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_07_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Morris Commercial C9 truck, the CS9 replaced a number of WWI-era designs. The open-top turret usually mounted a 13.7 mm Boys anti-tank rifle, and a 7.62 mm Bren light machine gun. The 94 hp engine gave the vehicle good performance on soft ground - when fitted with the correct tires."
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_08:0 "Daimler Mk II Armoured Car"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_08_short:0 "Daimler Mk II"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_08_desc:0 "A heavier development of the successful Daimler Dingo scout car. Produced in large quantities, their welded, sloped hulls were relatively well armoured, while the 4.1 litre 95 hp engine gave decent performance. The armoured car was equipped with a 2 pdr 40mm gun, and a coaxial 7.92 Besa machine gun."

 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_09_short:0 "Humber Mk IV"
 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_09_desc:0 "Made by the Rootes Group by combining the Indian Army's Karrier KT4 artillery tractor, with the Guy armoured car. The definitive production Mk IV version mounted a US-made 37 mm gun, and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun. The vehicle had a long career and surplus Humbers were sold to nations all over the world."

 RAJ_motorized_AC_equipment_099_desc:0 "Built by the Associated Equipment Company on the chassis of their Matador 4x4 artillery tractor. The 158 hp diesel engine enabled the vehicle to mount a 6 pdr 57 mm gun, and coaxial 7.92 mm Besa machine gun, while still maintaining excellent mobility on long patrols. The AEC remained valuable for years to come."

Equipped with a Vickers 7.7 mm machine gun, and Horstmann suspension, the Mk IV was the definitive early version of the design. Mk IVs served throughout the Commonwealth but quickly became outdated."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The first Commonwealth three-man Lt.TK in service. The extra crew member, and an updated armament of 7.7 mm and 15 mm Besa machine guns in a twin mount, made the Mk V a far more effective combat vehicle. The increase in weight affected mobility on rough ground somewhat, but overall range was largely unchanged."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Built in several versions, and in large quantities. The Mk VIa retained the armament of the Mk V, while the Mk VIb had a compact 15 mm Besa and an upgraded 7.92 mm coaxial. The Mk VIc kept the 7.92 mm coaxial, while the main gun was a long barrel 15 mm Besa, which had excellent muzzle velocity but limited punch."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "Vickers-Armstrong chief tank designer - Leslie Little - designed the Tetrarch as a major upgrade to the Mk VI. It had a 2 pdr 40 mm gun with a 7.92 mm Besa coaxial, and a new coil suspension system. The light weight of the vehicle coupled with the Meadows 165 hp engine, made the Tetratch fast and easy to transport."

 RAJ_light_uk_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The last of the Vickers-Armstrong Lt.TKs produced. Developed from the Tetrarch, the length, width, and armour protection of the Mk VIII was increased, and a new power-assisted steering system was installed. Mk VIIIs served in mainly auxillary roles as Commonwealth armoured divisions gradually withdrew Lt.TKs."

The Gewehr 98 action, using stripper clip loading with the powerful 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge, successfully combined and improved various bolt action engineering concepts."

It was one of the final developments in the long line of Mauser military rifles. Fitted with a telescopic sight it served also as a sniper rifle and could be fitted with a rifle grenade."

 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "By 1940, it became apparent that some form of a semi-automatic rifle with a higher rate of fire than existing bolt-action rifle models was necessary to improve the infantry's combat efficiency. The selected Rifle was the G41 (Walter) and it used a mechanism known as the "Bang" system (after its Danish designer Søren H. Bang). In this system, propellant gases were captured by a cone-shaped gas trap at the muzzle, which in turn deflected them to operate a small piston which in turn pushed on a long piston rod that opened the breech and re-loaded the gun. It included fixed 10-round magazines that were loaded using two of the stripper clips from the Karabiner 98k, utilizing the same German-standard 7.92×57mm Mauser rounds. It suffered from fouling problems, since gasses at the muzzle cool down and deposit solid carbon fouling. The muzzle assembly consisted of tight-fitting parts and was difficult to keep clean, disassemble, and maintain in the field."

During its course of development which started in 1923 it had several different designations like MKb (H), MP43 and MP44 before it was eventually called STG-44. It was reported to be durable, rugged and to work under all weather conditions. By all accounts, the StG 44 fulfilled its role effectively, particularly on the Eastern Front, offering a greatly increased volume of fire compared to standard infantry rifles. It would go on to influence the AK-47 in the years following. Its lasting effect was its major influence on modern infantry small arms development, giving rise to an entire class of weapons using the name assault rifle."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "By 1940, it became apparent that some form of a semi-automatic rifle with a higher rate of fire than existing bolt-action rifle models was necessary to improve the infantry's combat efficiency. The selected Rifle was the G41 (Walter) and it used a mechanism known as the "Bang" system (after its Danish designer Søren H. Bang). In this system, propellant gases were captured by a cone-shaped gas trap at the muzzle, which in turn deflected them to operate a small piston which in turn pushed on a long piston rod that opened the breech and re-loaded the gun. It included fixed 10-round magazines that were loaded using two of the stripper clips from the Karabiner 98k, utilizing the same German-standard 7.92×57mm Mauser rounds. It suffered from fouling problems, since gasses at the muzzle cool down and deposit solid carbon fouling. The muzzle assembly consisted of tight-fitting parts and was difficult to keep clean, disassemble, and maintain in the field."

The design was based on that of the earlier G41(W), but incorporating an improved short-stroke piston gas system derived from the Soviet Tokarev SVT-40, and it incorporated innovative mass-production techniques."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The StG 44 (Sturmgewehr 44 or assault rifle 44) was the first successful and widely produced design to use a new shorter 7,92 x 33 cartridge, which permitted controllable automatic fire from a weapon more compact than a battle rifle. During its course of development which started in 1923 it had several different designations like MKb (H), MP43 and MP44 before it was eventually called STG-44. It was reported to be durable, rugged and to work under all weather conditions. By all accounts, the StG 44 fulfilled its role effectively, particularly on the Eastern Front, offering a greatly increased volume of fire compared to standard infantry rifles. It would go on to influence the AK-47 in the years following. Its lasting effect was its major influence on modern infantry small arms development, giving rise to an entire class of weapons using the name assault rifle."

It used a low-recoil 6.5x50mm cartridge which lacked penetrating power. It was a very long rifle, at 1.28 meters, due to the Japanese emphasis on bayonet fighting. The rifle gained an additional 0.4m when the bayonet was fixed. About 3,400,000 were produced from 1906 to 1942."

The Type 99 was designed similarly to the Type 38, but fired a 7.7mm cartridge instead of a 6.5x50mm. It was a solid bolt-action rifle, but was outclassed at close range by automatic weapons. While it was intended to completely replace the Type 38, this never materialized due to resource and production constraints. About 3,500,000 were built from 1939 to 1945."

With the Ausf M chassis, the engine was located near the middle of the vehicle, and the armament was placed at the rear in a specially designed armoured section. The superstructure could fold down to allow 360-degree traverse at low elevation.

After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army. Production ended in 1942, when its main armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1,400 Pz. 38(t)s were manufactured. The chassis of the Pz. 38(t) continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942–1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944–1945) tank destroyers and its derivative vehicles. It was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II that were the Panzerwaffe's main tanks during the outset of WWII. The Panzer 38(t) performed well in the Polish Campaign in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940. It was better armed than the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks. It was on a par with most Lt.TK designs of the era, although it was unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of medium, heavy and infantry tank designs."

The base plate of the mortar was under the hull and could be quickly lowered and retracted for movement and firing, the lowered base plate would absorb the recoil of the heavy mortar and protect the suspension.The ability to observe its own mortar shells impacts on the battlefield greatly increased accuracy while light AT fire could be shrugged off.

The shell - a modified 82mm mortar round combined with a redesigned 105mm cartridge - had an effective range of 750m ( at which a 1 meter target could be hit reliably ) and a penetration of 140mm, it so gave the usually low velocity HEAT shells a much better trajectory and accuracy."

 panzer_vi_td_equipment_1_desc:0 "Porsche Tigers converted into Heavy Tank hunters, armed with the latest version of the longer 88 mm L/71 anti-tank gun. Since Porsches Tiger Prototype was rejected, the chassis was chosen for conversion to a TD inspired by the Nashorn. In comparison, the regular Tiger was equipped with the “short” version of the 88mm, the KwK 36 L/56. Performance was such that the maximal effective range in direct fire was estimated to be 4500 to 5000 m. This was way beyond anything the Red Army possessed at the time. With this gun and an impressive frontal armor of 200mm this TD would theoretically be an excellent tank killer - and had a great kill rate - but its mechanical unreliability was troublesome and more Elefants were abandoned and destroyed by its own crew because of breakdowns than actually killed by the enemy. The weight was 70 tons and it was powered by a complicated array of 2 x Maybach HL120 which in turn powered an electric Siemens-Schuckert 500 VA generator which in turn powered electric motors. It managed a top road speed of 30 km/h."

Because of the shape of the Hull it was sometimes called Turtle or Battleship. It had an elongated wedgeshaped front with steeply angled 200mm of armour and a angled keel-like turretless upper hull. On the upper front was a armored shutter which housed a ´leichter Ladungswerfer 200mm´. It was a spigot mortar with 700m range ( a slim spigot where the projectile was slid over and electrically ignited ) which was withdrawn from regular service. The mortar had a loading chamber which closes off to the interior after the mortar is loaded. Since the mortar shells only weighed 23kg, loading was much easier and faster than with the RW61. It carried a loadout of 76 shells. In addition small 100mm doughnut shaped mortar rounds for point defense for the spigot were carried which would burst 2 meters over the hull and spray the surrounding with shrapnell. Specially trained Combat pioneers accompanied the Rammtiger and stayed in radio contact to coordinate with the close defense mortar use."

The Fw 190 A-1 provided greater firepower with its 4 x 7,92mm MG17 and 2 x 20mm MG FF/M than the Bf 109, and, at low to medium altitude, superior maneuverability, in the opinion of German pilots who flew both fighters. The Fw 190A series' was not a high-altitude interceptor its performance suffered higher than 6000m. The armament was later upgraded from A-1 through -10 by replacing the 7,92mm MGs with 13mm MG131, the 20mm eventually with 30mm MK108. With its BMW 801C engine at 1560 HP it had a top speed of 656 km/h. The wide landing gear - unlike the 109 - made landings on rough air strips much less dangerous."

The aircraft kept some of the features of the earlier Ju 87, such as the inverted gull wing and two man crew. It had added finally retractable landing gear, as well as improved armour and armament. Most notably, the Ju 187 incorporated a rotating vertical tail. When rotated down, the tail would give the air gunner, armed with a remote-controlled rear turret and armament of one 151/20 20 mm cannon and one MG 131 13mm machine gun, an unobstructed field of fire. At first it was no better regarding speed as the Ju-87D with the Jumo 213 allowing 400 km/h but soon got the larger Jumo 222 providing 2000 HP which finally got rid of its teething problems. Now the plane had a maximum speed of 560 km/h."

The ´A´ was easily recognisable by its inverted gull wings and fixed spatted undercarriage. Upon the main gear legs a Jericho-Trompete (Jericho trumpet) siren was mounted, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air power. The Stuka's design included several innovative features, including automatic pull-up dive brakes to recover from its attack dive if the pilot blacked out. The Ju 87A was only capable of carrying a 500 kg bomb without rear gunner/radio operator otherwise just a 250kg and 4x50kg bombs. It used the Jumo 210A (610 HP) at first but even with the improved Jumo 210D  (680 HP) it was still underpowered and only barely faster than the Biplanes.It carried 2 x 7,92mm MG17 forward and one 7,92mm MG15 to the rear.

While still lacking in speed, version B and later versions of the Stuka featured heavier armament and proved extremely effective when operating with air superiority. Even with the much larger Jumo 211D producing 1200 HP it still was underpowered for its drag-heavy body and achieved only a maximum speed of 390 km/h. It carried 2 x 7,92mm MG17 forward and one 7,92mm MG15 to the rear. Now a 500k bomb could be carried with no problems. It was one of the very few divebombers beside e.g. allegedly the Vultee Vengeance that could actually operate at a 90° dive, most other designs could not exceed 70°."

Armour protection was increased and the rear gunner position switched to a new dual-barrel 7.92mm  MG 81Z machine gun. Engine power was increased again, the Jumo 211J now delivering 1,420 HP allowing a top speed of 450 km/h.  Bomb carrying ability was nearly quadrupled from 500 kg  in the B-version to 1,800 kg  in the D-version (max. load for short ranges, overload condition), a typical bomb load ranged from 500–1,200 kg.

The power-plant was still a Junkers Jumo 211J, and two 30 mm cannons were added. It was also designed to carry a 1,000 kg free-fall bomb load. Furthermore, the armoured protection of the Ilyushin IL-2 Sturmovik was copied to protect the crew from ground fire now that the Ju 87 would be required to conduct low level attacks. The maximum speed slightly rose to 480 km/h probably by removing dive bombing equipment. It was had suggested using two 37 mm Flak18 guns, each one in a self-contained under-wing gun pod using tungsten carbide rounds.

Such designs were not well established at the time, and the 24-cylinder DB 606 "power system" - actually a twin DB601 engine, combined with the cooling and maintenance problems caused by the tight nacelles housing the system, caused a tendency for catching fire in flight: due to these issues it got the nickname Reichsfeuerzeug ("Reich's lighter") or "Flaming Coffin". It eventually matured into a usable design when the engine troubles were adressed by version A3/R2 and the DB610 ´power systems´(2 x DB605 engines) with a combined power of 2900 HP each. Its maximum speed was then 565 km/h and its bomb load 7000 kg. The defensive armament was 7 guns ranging from 7,92mm up to 20mm."

The quartet of BMW jet engines gave the C-series Ar 234s an airspeed that was found to be about 20% higher than the twin-Jumo 004 equipped B series airframes, and the faster climb to altitude meant more efficient flight and increased range.

This well-balanced, modern and relatively cheap tank immediately drew the attention of Soviet officers, who felt the need to keep in touch with western technologies. The earliest production model was a twin-turret type. Each turret had an observation slit and a round firing port for the DT machine-gun. These turrets existed in four different models and configurations, although still mounted in the same locations, with the same height and generally same features. All had a 240° arc of fire and armor ranging from 13 to 15 mm (0.51-0.59 in), although the very first 1931 models had only 10 mm of mediocre alloy, susceptible to machine-gun fire. The model 1931 (100 units), 1932 (1361) and 1933 (before upgrading - 576) were all twin-turreted versions. About 2038 were built in all. "

This proved insufficient in the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938, so the tank was upgraded once more in February 1939 to have an underturret box with sloped (23°) 20 mm armoured plates. The turret featured an armour increase to 20 mm at 18 degrees sloping. This time it was designated T-26-1 (known as the T-26 mod. 1939 in modern sources).

The 45mm 20K gun was housed - as break from previous Soviet light tanks - in a three-man turret as was the case on medium and heavy tanks such as the T-28, T-35 and KV-1. Additionally, all T-50s had radios, a feature only found on the commander's vehicle of earlier light tanks.

These tanks were horrendous owing to their poor maneuverability, weak guns, and inferior armor. The T-70 was an attempt by N.A. Astrov to counter these three problems. Whilst the 45mm gun was generally better suited to the reality of tank-on-tank warfare, it still had poor mobility. Armour thickness on the turret front was 60 mm, hull front and sides: 45 mm. The tank’s legacy passed on into the somewhat well-known SU-76 self-propelled gun, which was also a less than desirable tank.

The ZiS-3 was placed at the rear, protected by an enclosed 10-35 mm thick sloped armored casemate, however the vehicle was not completely enclosed by armour, the rear roof and upper rear side was exposed. Its simple construction made it the second most produced Soviet armoured vehicle of World War II, after the T-34 tank.  It was also nicknamed ´Golozhopiy Ferdinand´ ( "bare-arsed Ferdinand") due to its very light armor and somewhat similar silhouette, when compared to the german 65 tons Ferdinand tank destroyer.

In wheeled mode, the tank was steered by pivoting the front road wheels. Soviet tank forces soon found the convertible option of little practical use; in a country with few paved roads, it consumed space and added needless complexity and weight.

The front was made by extending the sloped armour of the T-34 upwards while also reducing the angle of the slope slightly to 50° to increase the available space. The frontal gun mounting allowed a vertical move from -3 to +26 degrees and ten degrees to either side.

The KV's strengths were armour of slightly sloped 90mm (75mm at sides) that was impenetrable by any tank weapon then in service except at point-blank, and good firepower. It also had serious flaws: the transmission (a twenty-year-old Holt Caterpillar design) was the main problem, there was some truth to rumors of Soviet drivers having to shift gears with a hammer and it was difficult to steer. The KV-1 had a weight of 45 tons and powered by the 550 hp V12 engine a top road speed of 40km/h could be reached. At introduction of the T-34 the question has arosen if a heavy tank is necessary when a medium tank carries the same gun.

The 85 mm proved capable of penetrating the Tiger I from 1000 m and the demand for it slowed production of the KV-85 tremendously. The KV-85 appeared on the front beginning in September 1943 and its production ended by December 1943. Soviet industry was therefore able to produce a heavy tank as well armed as the Tiger I before the end of 1943. Although the KV-85 was an excellent opponent to the Tigers and Panthers, it was essentially a stopgap once the IS tank entered full-scale production."

 #"Heavy tank destroyer based on the KV-1. This rather curious development for an assault gun was an attempt to increase the firepower of the KV-chassis. At first trials were made with a casemate system housing the U-13 system incorporating two 45mm and one 76,2 guns to fire all at once or separate. This configuration was quickly forbidden by Stalin himself in December´41 and another configuration was found with the U-14 system incorporating two 76,2mm F-34 guns side by side ( with a 15°gun traverse each to the sides). In theory a salvo would consist of one gun firing, reloading and in the time the first gun reloads the second gun aims and fires... again in theory roughly raising the firing speed from approx.5 shots/minute for the F34 to 10 shots/minute, in reality it was much lower. However since the front casemate was heavily armoured with 85mm and around 20cm lower than the KV-1, it was hard to kill. With its Model V2K engine providing 600 HP its top road speed was 43km/h."

The SMK - named after Sergei Mironovich Kirov, a Communist Party official assassinated in 1934 - however was employed in the Winter war until it ran on a mine but found some interest. The original Prototype was considered to be too lightly armoured (especially its rear) for its heavy chassis and no real alternative to the KV-1 so it was uparmed and uparmoured to 100mm frontal armour sloped at 45° and 100mm for the turrets resulting in a total weight of 65 tons. The layout of the SMK was a 2-turret two-tiers design and housed a upgraded 122mm M-30 M.1938-L/22,7 main gun turret on the upper tier and the secondary turret had a 57mm ZiS-4 L/69,3 on the lower tier. The power output of the GAM-34BT 850 HP engine was not sufficient anymore due to the increased weight and the transmission had to be changed, giving the vehicle a top road speed of 20km/h."

The result was a powerful 100 ton tank of relatively unusual appearance. The driver-mechanic and radio operator-machine gunner received special cupolas and the rhomboid-shaped turret was of relatively large size. The KV-5 used the ZIS-6 107mm main gun and was heavily armoured with frontal armour of 170mm thick, side armour 150mm and 170mm on the turret. The vehicle was to be powered by a single 1200hp engine. Development was almost complete in August 1941, but changes had to be made to the hull design as a 1200hp engine was not available, so two parallel-mounted conventional V-2K engines with 600 HP each were installed instead. By Jan 1942 the KV-5 design was practically fully completed."

It used the same carriage as the 210 mm gun M1939 (Br-17) as well as the same firing platform and control mechanism. After simply doubling the caliber to 610mm ( retaining the caliber length of L/14,2 ) the newly developed gun was installed on the chassis of the super heavy KV-5 Tank as it was the only chassis heavy enough to carry it. The bottom section was cut out and the remaining carriage parts adapted to fit in the turret ring, before firing, the gun carriage is lowered to the ground to lighten the stress on the chassis during firing.

Such tanks had problems in negotiating difficult terrain - especially rivers - thus it got 2 pairs of tracks ( with 2 sets of tracks each, in total 8). Each set of tracks had hydraulic arms which could adjust the hull from 20 cm to 2 m ground clearance. Ford depth was 4 meters and it could be further waterproofed to snorkel. The extra wide tracks divided the weight over a large area reducing ground pressure, even mud could be traversed which was difficult even for a medium tank. Its armour was well sloped at 60° and 180mm thick, the turret had 200mm of armour. The top armour was ridged and sloped to increase resistance vs. aerial bombs."

The IP-1 was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tailskid undercarriage and an open cockpit. Construction throughout was all-metal, and like its predecessor, its horizontal stabiliser was mounted high to avoid gasses from the underwing cannons. Once again, however, trials proved the concept a failure. Nevertheless, the IP-1 was ordered into production, with a modified version that dispensed with the cannon and instead carried two 20 mm autocannon and up to eight 7,62mm ShKAS machine guns in total inside the wings and in pods under each wing."

When the performance of the I-Z and its single-shot DRP cannon proved disappointing, L. Kurchevsky developed a new recoilless 75mm APK-4 which could fire five shots instead of just one. The IP-1 was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tailskid undercarriage and an open cockpit. Construction throughout was all-metal, and like its predecessor, its horizontal stabiliser was mounted high to avoid gasses from the underwing cannons. Once again, however, trials proved the concept a failure. Nevertheless, the IP-1 was ordered into production, with a modified version that dispensed with the cannon and instead carried two 20 mm autocannon and up to eight 7,62mm ShKAS machine guns in total inside the wings and in pods under each wing. With its single Shvetsov M-25 engine developing 710 HP it achieved a maximum speed of 410 km/h."

Flight testing showed controllability issues when landing at high weights and the engines proved to be hard to start at low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements. Armament were five 20 mm ShVAK Sh-20 cannon in a dorsal turret and in flexible mountings at the nose, beam and ventral positions.

The Yak-1 had a especially light tail, and it was easy to tip over and to hit the ground with the propeller. Often, technicians had to keep the tail down, which could lead to accidents, with aircraft taking off with technicians still on the rear fuselage. Later added weights fixed that. The armament was - especially compared to the LaGG-1 - lighter with a single 20mm ShVAK cannon and one 12.7mm Berezin UBS machine gun but it was a certainly better plane than the LaGG."

The C-46 served in a similar role to its Douglas-built counterpart, the C-47 Skytrain, but it was not as extensively produced as the latter. By November 1943, 721 modifications had been made to production models, although many were minor, such as fuel system changes and fewer cabin windows were also adopted. The military model was fitted with double cargo doors, a strengthened floor and a hydraulically operated cargo handling winch; 40 folding seats were the sole passenger accommodation for what was essentially a cargo hauler. Tests indicated that the production C-46 was capable of carrying a substantial payload of 6800 kg or 40 troops, and it could fly well on one engine. Its maximum air speed was 430 km/h and its range was 5000 km."

The armor was thinner than the Chi-To and the engine compartment was moved to the front. The mortar had a range of 3000m and launched a 170 kg projectile. The gun itself weighed close to 1.5 tons, and to keep the center of gravity from shifting and tipping the vehicle over, it could not be elevated more than 50 degrees. For firing it was lowered over the back of the vehicle to the ground, onto a base plate and a loading device helped with the heavy shells.

The mortar consists of a steel tube closed at one end by a steel base-plate, which rests on a wooden platform. The 300 kg shells fit around and on top of the tube, instead of being dropped inside, making this a spigot mortar. The range of each shot was adjusted by adding different size powder charges at the base of the round. The specially reinforced barrels could only handle 10 to 15 shots apiece before becoming damaged and unusable, for this reason the SPG carried a number of replacement spigot barrels. The SPG had a very limited range of 2000m ( 1200m with the regular version) and thus retained all secondary armament and armour of the tank version.

These had several limitations, like weak protection, machine-gun armament, and no traversing turret, which all prevented any use against other tanks. This issue was first addressed with a prototype, the FIAT-Ansaldo Carro d’Assalto L5/36 based on a CV-35 tankette equipped with a new suspension and a light traversing turret, armed with a 37 mm L/26 gun and a coaxial Breda 6.5 mm machine-gun. The armor was raised to 30 mm, speed lowered to 32 km/h and the range was only 80 km. A second prototype had the gun placed in the hull, and a fully traversible light machine-gun turret. Despite some production advantages, the Army choose a new scaled-up model. The designations of the italian light tanks were L for leggera/light, tonnage and year of service entry."

The hull was short and the maximum armor, 40 mm, was only found on the gun mantlet and frontal glacis, thought capable to stop the british 2 pounder (40 mm) gun fire, at least at higher ranges. The rest of the armor was and 20 to 6 mm thick. This was a cramped 2-man tank, with the gunner/commander on the left side, in the turret, and the driver on the right. The overall weight was 6.8 tons. The FIAT SPD 18D petrol four-cylinder developed 70 HP and allowed a top road speed of 32 km/h. The suspensions used a modern torsion-bar system, with front drive sprocket and rear idler wheel, two rubberized pairs of road wheels and three return rollers on each side. It was armed either with a 20mm 37/26 or modelo 35 autocannon. Due to performance demands of the army the L6/40 was further developed into the faster and better armed M6T and the preseries production started in May 1941."

ITA_light_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "The medium tanks were still hampered by their riveted construction and old fashioned leaf spring bogie suspension, which limited top speed, so after the first encounters with British Cruiser tanks, the idea soon emerged of a similar high speed vehicle. However in early 1941, italian engineers did not have access to the Christie suspension patent, so the design was obtained after reverse-engineering captured BT-5 from the spanish civil war and british Cruiser Mk.III. It needed still further development and the armament was barely adequate at that time, but the decision was made to put it in production immediately and improve it "on the way". Although the armour was riveted, the 30mm frontal and the side armours were well sloped and gave the tank some protection at least against the british 2 pounder. The CA L16/41 weighed 16 tons, was armed with a 37mm L/32 gun and had a top road speed of 55 km/h."

The design of the M11/39 was influenced by the British Vickers 6-Ton. A novelty was the placement of the final reduction gears inside the front-mounted drive sprockets, eliminating the need for enlarged final drive housings in the bow armour. Service use of the M11/39 was short due to several deficiencies in its design, particularly the placement of the main 37mm L/40 gun in the hull due to insufficient turret space which instead housed dual 8 mm machine guns. The M11/39 had other shortcomings: its endurance and performance were poor, and its SPA V8-diesel with 105 HP was underpowered only allowing a relatively slow top road speed of 32 km/h, it was mechanically unreliable and its 30 mm maximum riveted steel armour could only withstand 20 mm fire but was vulnerable to British 2-pounder guns at any range."

american_light_amph_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The M59 was an American armored personnel carrier that entered service in the spring of 1954 replacing the M75. It had three key advantages over the M75: it was amphibious, had a lower profile, and was considerably cheaper to produce."

m75_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M75 shared many chassis/suspension components with the M41 Walker Bulldog Lt.TK, which was also powered by a Continental air-cooled engine. It had a cross-drive transmission (permitting pivoting, etc.), but was steered through two vertical handles, simulating the laterals of earlier vehicles controlled by track clutching/braking. The approximate cost of the vehicle was $72,000, which contributed to the early halting of production. The high profile (height) of the vehicle was also a negative factor. Additionally, the engine air cooling vents were considered to be vulnerable to small arms fire. However, the reliability of its drive system was far superior to that of its replacement, the M59."

NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01:0 "Austin 7"
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01_short:0 "Austin 7"
NZL_motorized_lia_equipment_01_desc:0 "A military liaison vehicle used to coordinate between units in the field and light transport. This is a military adaption of a later model of one of the most successful series of British cars, the Austin 7. The modifications are relatively sparse, with anything not strictly necessary stripped out, more storage, military wheels, tow rings and an altered fuel tank. Historically the Austin 7 was produced between 1922 and 1939. The British Army purchased a number of batches of Austin 7's for liaison use prewar. Austin and Morris assembly in New Zealand started in 1934. Civilian cars of all kinds were requisitioned at the onset of war, and NZ infantry battalions had an official establishment of 6 Austin two-seaters as of 1941."

NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Lt.TK Mk V"
NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The first Commonwealth three-man Lt.TK in service. The extra crew member, and an updated armament of 7.7 mm and 15 mm Besa machine guns in a twin mount, made the Mk V a far more effective combat vehicle. The increase in weight affected mobility on rough ground somewhat, but overall range was largely unchanged."

NZL_light_uk_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "Vickers-Armstrong chief tank designer - Leslie Little - designed the Tetrarch as a major upgrade to the Mk VI. It had a 2 pdr 40 mm gun with a 7.92 mm Besa coaxial, and a new coil suspension system. The light weight of the vehicle coupled with the Meadows 165 hp engine, made the Tetratch fast and easy to transport."
