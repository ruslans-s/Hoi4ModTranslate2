USA_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The M3 "Lee" ( with the US pattern turret) or "Grant" ( with the UK pattern turret) was an American medium tank developed in 1940 and produced from 1941 on. It weighed 27 tons and sported 2 main guns, a short barreled 75mm L/31 M2 gun which was mounted in a sponson mount in the front right, and a 37mm L/53,5 M5 gun which was mounted on a small turret on top of the hull. The 37mm was useless versus most tanks at that time, but the 75mm was a desperately needed tank killer which shifted the balance of power in north africa when the lend-lease tanks were employed by the british troops. It was fairly well armored with 51mm of sloped frontal armor and 38mm of side and rear armor. They were shipped to various nations and used by the Australians, the British, and even the Soviet Army. It was a fairly reliable tank, but had massive drawbacks such as being tall and endangered the crew with interior spalling of the rivetted armor. Due to this, it was quickly replaced by the M4."

Pershing, who led the American Expeditionary Force in Europe in World War I. It was briefly used in the final months of World War II and extensively during the Korean War. Intended as a replacement of the M4 Sherman, the prolonged time of development meant that only a small number saw combat in the European theater, most notably in the 9th Armored Division's dramatic dash to take the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen."

american_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The M2A2 Light Tank was a light tank designed and built by Rock Island Arsenal. It required 4 men to crew and could reach a top speed of 58 km/h. With only two 0.50 caliber machineguns and 16mm of armor at its thickest point, the M2A2 was severely underpowered and soon replaced by later models."

american_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed by Rock Island Arsenal for the U.S. Cavalry, the M1 Combat Car was a tank designed in 1935. It was a light ( 9,1 tons) and speedy vehicle that could move up to 72 km/h. This speed was its defining quality as it was designed to break through lines and exploit weak points such as horse mounted cavalry would. As its turret was only armed with 2 machineguns, a 0.50 and a 0.30 caliber, it stood almost no chance of damaging enemy AFVs."

Instead of a 0.50 caliber machine gun, it had a M5 37mm L/53,5 gun in a single turret for its main armament. Its frontal armor was upgraded to 25mm and the secondary armament included 5 x 0,30 caliber machineguns when fully kitted."

american_light_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M3 Stuart, which was an upgrade on the M2 Light tank was the primary light tank of the war for the United States. It had a M5 37mm gun ( a slightly shortened version of the infantry anti tank gun) and up to 4 x 0.30cal MG´s, 38mm of armour on the stepped front plate and 51mm on the gun mantlet, and was crewed by 4 men. At first its armour was rivetted and later welded. It weighed 12,7 tons and with its Continental-Wright W-670 engine producing 250 HP it could reach a top road speed of 58 km/h. With a total of almost 23.000 ( including the M5), it was the second most produced American tank in the war."

american_light_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "Due to a demand for radial engines, the M3 Stuart was modified to employ twin V8 Cadillac car engines of a combined output of 220 HP and was redesignated as M5. It also had an automatic transmission which made operating and training for the vehicle easier. Its front armour plate was redesigned and got a sloped singular plate of 29mm. Like the M3, its greatest weakness was its small gun which size was not improved from the M3, however it got a slightly longer bore (L/53,5) which made it identical to the towed anti tank gun version. The M5 weighed 15,2 tons and its top road speed was 56 km/h."

american_light_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "The Chaffee came in to service in 1944 and was designed to replace the M3/M5 Stuart. In Africa, the M3 Stuart struggled to pierce Axis armor with its weak 37mm gun. To remedy this, the M24 was designed with a powerful M6 75mm L/39 gun which proved sufficient against Axis medium armor. Its armour was very light with 25mm to be able to carry the gun and due to the weight being 18,4 tons it was also about as fast as the M5 Stuart with a top speed of 56 km/h using the same engine."

american_light_tank_equipment_7_desc:0 "The M41 Walker Bulldog or officially called the 76mm Gun Tank, M41, , fulfilled the need for a modern new light tank. It was armed with a 76mm L/52 M42A1 rifled main gun which was sufficient for disabling most light and medium AFVs of the period. It had 25mm armor on both the front and side, and he turret mantle had 38mm of armor. It was considerably bigger as the M24 and weighed 23.5 tons, but with its powerful Continental 500 HP engine it could still achieve a top speed of 72 km/h."

The design incorporated a 57mm L/43 gun M1, a US production of the British Ordnance QF 6 pounder, mounted on an M3 Half-track. Its maximal armour was 16mm. The vehicle weighed about 9.5 tons and its top road speed was 72 km/h. The firing of the gun tended to demolish the headlights on the halftrack and also the engine hood causing damage to the engine."

Its overall silouette was lower than the T48 GMC, due to a smaller gun shield even though its gun was considerably bigger and more powerful. The vehicle weighed about 9.1 tons and its top road speed was 75 km/h."

hellcat_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M18 Hellcat (officially designated the 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 or M18 GMC) was an American tank destroyer based on the M24 light tank chassis. It was the fastest U.S. tank on road. The speed was attained by keeping armor thin to a maximum of 25mm, using the innovative Torqmatic automatic transmission, and by equipping the relatively light vehicle of 17,7 tons with the same radial engine used on the much larger Sherman tank."

The M13 production line was seamlessly changed to the M16 and many M13 were refitted to M16´s. The machine guns were fired remotely and powered by a small electrical motor near the back of the turret. It was developed in 1942 in response to a requirement for a mobile anti-aircraft (SPAA) vehicle. It was replaced by the more heavily armed M15 Gun Motor Carriage.

The M19 evolved from the 40 mm Gun Motor Carriage T65 project, which was based on the M5 light tank chassis. Although trials were successful, the project was stopped since the M5A1 light tank chassis was being phased out of production. The Armored Force still needed a modern light tracked anti-aircraft vehicle, so they made a new project (called T65E1) based on the new T24 chassis (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret with twin 40mm L/60 Bofors AA guns at the rear with the engines in the middle of the chassis.
