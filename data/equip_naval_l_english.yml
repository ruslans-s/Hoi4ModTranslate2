 ITA_lr_patrol_submarine_0_desc:0 "Ettore Fieramosca was an Italian submarine which served with the Regia Marina in World War II. She was named after Ettore Fieramosca an Italian condottiero of the 16th century. Ettore Fieramosca was designed by the firm Bernardis and was intended to be a cruiser submarine which carried a seaplane in a waterproof hangar and a 203 mm (8 in) gun; such a design was inspired by the similar (although bigger) Surcouf, then under construction in France. Several prototype seaplanes were designed but not deployed and the hangar was removed in 1931. The deck gun was initially a 120 mm (5 in) 27-calibre OTO model of 1924, but this was later replaced by a 120 mm 45-calibre OTO model of 1931."

 ITA_lr_patrol_submarine_3:0 "Ammiraglio Cagni Class"
 ITA_lr_patrol_submarine_3_desc:0 "These submarines were designed as commerce raiders for oceanic operations. They had high endurance and a large torpedo load for extended patrols. A smaller 450 mm (18 in) torpedo was chosen, rather than the standard 533 mm (21 in), as the Italians believed this was adequate to deal with merchant ships. The boats were designed to have the range to sail non-stop from Italy to Kismayu, Italian Somaliland where a new submarine base was to be built. In order to operate in the Indian Ocean Monsoon the submarines were fitted with large conning towers and armed with two 100 mm (4 in) / 47 caliber guns."

 USA_lr_patrol_submarine_6:0 "Tang Class (Block II)"
 USA_lr_patrol_submarine_6_desc:0 "FM 38D 8-1/8 diesels onboard. The Tang-class submarines were an American class of submarines developed from the GUPPY conversion program for World War II submarines, which incorporated German Type XXI U-boat technology into the United States Navy's submarine design. They comprised the state of the art in post-World War II conventionally powered submarine design; some of their features were incorporated into the nuclear-powered submarines that replaced them in the 1950s and beyond. An unsuccessful innovation of the Tang design was the General Motors EMD 16-338 lightweight, compact, high-speed "pancake" engine. When the boats went to sea in the early 1950s, the new engines did not work well. Their compact design made them difficult to maintain, and they tended to leak oil into their generators. In 1956, the Navy decided to replace the "pancake" engines with ten-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse opposed-piston 38D 8-1/8 diesels."

 FRA_light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "Starting in the mid-1880s, the German Navy began to modernize its cruising force, which at that time relied on a mixed collection of sail and steam frigates and corvettes. \n The Victoria Louise class of protected cruisers was the last class of ships of that type built for the German Imperial Navy. The class design introduced the combined clipper and ram bow and the blocky sides that typified later German armoured cruisers. The class comprised five vessels, Victoria Louise, the lead ship, Hertha, Freya, Vineta, and Hansa. The ships were laid down in 1895–1896, and were launched in 1897–1898 and commissioned into the fleet over the following year."

The class comprised SMS Magdeburg, the lead ship, Breslau, Strassburg, and Stralsund. All four ships were laid down in 1910 and were completed by the end of 1912. They were armed with a main battery of twelve 10.5 cm guns, though over the course of their careers, Breslau, Strassburg, and Stralsund were rearmed with more powerful 15 cm guns. They displaced 4,570 t (4,500 long tons) at full load and were rated at a top speed of 27.5 knots (50.9 km/h; 31.6 mph), though all four vessels exceeded that figure on trials."

Torpedo capacity was also increased from 11 to 14 torpedoes – two were stored externally in pressure tight containers underneath the upper deck. To improve on maneuverability and the turning radius, twin rudders were fitted directly behind the propellers. This new twin rudder arrangement allowed the single stern torpedo tube to be brought inside the pressure hull, making internal reloads at sea possible. On the Type VIIA, the stern torpedo tube was situated externally, and could be reloaded only at port. A total of 24 Type VIIBs were commissioned."

As British ASW weapons and equipment improved, depth charges were becoming more effective and accurate at finding submerged U-boats. The necessity to dive even deeper to evade depth-charge attacks was becoming increasingly important. In the Type VIIC/41, the crush depth was increased from 200m to 250m.In order to increase the crush depth, all non-essential equipment were removed and many others were replaced with newer, lighter material. The weight savings was used to increase hull thickness from 18.5mm to 21mm, which increased the crush depth to 250m. These modifications were considered minor and did not warrant a new sub-type number, hence it was indicated by adding a suffix “41”, indicating that the modification approval was given in the year 1941.

Most of the boats had a turbine engine, only the first 21 had an old fashioned expansion engine. These were the boats with a top speed about 3 knots slower than the turbine powered ones. Many of these boats survived World War I and were used in the Reichsmarine or Kriegsmarine as training ships, fleet tenders or torpedo recovery vessels. Therefore, several ones were completely rebuild with new, larger superstructures and a new main armament (10,5 cm guns instead of 8,8 cm ones).

These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 AST_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 AST_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-Class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 AST_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"

Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-Class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-Class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 AST_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 AST_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-Class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The Class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge Class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 AST_sh_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 AST_sh_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a Class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 AST_sh_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 AST_sh_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II Class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-Class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 AST_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 AST_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 AST_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 AST_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 AST_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 AST_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious Class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 AST_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 AST_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-Class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious Class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious Class."

They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only a limited number of the vessels survived the scrap head to WWI. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 CAN_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-Class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-Class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-Class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 CAN_light_cruiser_3:0 "Ceylon Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Ceylon Class of light cruisers was a sub-Class of the Crown Colony Class. The Royal Canadian Navy acquired HMS Uganda from the Royal Navy on October 21st, 1944. It was renamed HMCS Quebec in 1952. HMCS Uganda and, later, HMCS Ontario were the only two cruisers operated by Canada during WWII"
 CAN_light_cruiser_4:0 "Ontario Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Ontario Class was the Canadian designation for British Minotaur-Class (or Swiftsure-Class) light cruisers. These cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony Class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony Class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. HMS Minotaur was acquired by Canada in July of 1944 and commissioned as HMCS Ontario on May 25th, 1945. Ontario and HMCS Uganda were the only cruisers operated by Canada during WWII"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-Class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-Class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-Class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-Class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-Class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-Class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland Class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 CAN_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 CAN_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-Class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-Class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 CAN_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 CAN_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a Class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-Class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 CAN_battleship_1:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 CAN_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-Class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 CAN_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 CAN_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-Class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 CAN_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 CAN_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-Class battleships were the follow-up Class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-Class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-Class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 CAN_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 CAN_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-Class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The Class had a sleek hull, which gave it an excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge Class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 CAN_sh_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 CAN_sh_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a Class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 CAN_sh_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 CAN_sh_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II Class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-Class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 CAN_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 CAN_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 CAN_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 CAN_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 CAN_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 CAN_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious Class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 CAN_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 CAN_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-Class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious Class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious Class."

 NZL_sh_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II Class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-Class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NZL_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 NZL_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 NZL_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 NZL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NZL_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 NZL_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious Class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 NZL_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 NZL_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-Class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious Class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious Class."

They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 SAF_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 SAF_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-Class or Triton-Class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R Class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."

 SAF_destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 SAF_destroyer_1:0 "G/H/I Class"
 SAF_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The G, H, and I Class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F Class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F Class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 SAF_destroyer_2:0 "J/K/N Class"
 SAF_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal Class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."

 SAF_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "C-Class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only a limited number of the vessels survived the scrap head to WWI. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."

They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 SAF_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 SAF_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-Class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town Class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."

 SAF_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 SAF_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-Class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-Class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."

 SAF_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a Class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-Class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 SAF_battleship_1:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 SAF_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Queen Elizabeth-Class battleships were ordered under the 1912 Naval Program. These ships were the first to be equipped with 15 in. guns, and were considered the first fast battleships. They carried heavy armament for both primary and secondary roles and their thick armor made these vessels excellent warships, ideal for protecting the vast British Empire. Six ships were ordered but only five were commissioned and later modernized prior to WWII."
 SAF_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 SAF_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-Class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 SAF_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"

Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-Class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-Class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 SAF_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
